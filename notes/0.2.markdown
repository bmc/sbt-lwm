## Change in Setting and Task Key Namespace

*sbt-lwm* setting and task keys are already inside in inner `LWM` object,
for namespace scoping. This revision adds a trick by [Josh Suereth][], to make
usage easier. Basically, the keys are now defined like this:

    object LWM extends Plugin {
      object LWM {
        val Config = config("lwm") extend(Runtime)

        val sources = SettingKey[Seq[File]](
          "source-files", "List of sources to transform"
        ) in Config
    
        val targetDirectory = SettingKey[File](
          "target-directory", "Where to copy edited files"
        ) in Config

        ...
      }
    }

Putting the `in Config` after *each* setting or task changes the `build.sbt`
usage pattern from the clunky

    LWM.sources in LWM <<= ...

to the far more serenely intuitive

    LWM.sources <<= ...

## Changes in Setting Names

`LWM.sourceFiles` is now `LWM.sources`, for consistency with other SBT plugins
and settings.
